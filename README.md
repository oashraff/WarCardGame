# WarCardGame
This Python script simulates the classic card game "War". Players are dealt cards, and each round they compare their top card. The player with the higher card wins and collects both cards. If both cards are of equal value, a "war" occurs.

# How to Play
- Set up players and deck: Initialize two players and a deck of cards.
- Shuffle and Deal Cards: Shuffle the deck and deal half of the cards to each player.
- Start the Game Loop: Begin the game loop.
- Compare Cards: Each round, compare the top card of each player. The player with the higher card wins the round.
- War: If both cards have equal value, initiate a "war". Each player adds three more cards face down and one more face up. The player with the higher face-up card wins all the cards.
- End Game: The game ends when one player runs out of cards. The player with cards remaining wins.
